      "Nathan Conroy, DC, is certain that a healthy spine is key to a long, happy life. At Genesis Integrative Medicine in Geneva, Illinois, Dr. Conroy, DC, offers a variety of services to improve his patients\u2019 physical and overall health without medications or surgery. Inspired by his grandfather, a medical doctor, he pursued his degree in chiropractic care because of the many benefits chiropractic adjustments offer to the body. He brings over 15 years of experience in chiropractic care to Genesis Integrative Medicine.",
      "A graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dr. Conroy, DC, was impressed by a visit to a local chiropractic college and later enrolled in classes at the National University of Health Sciences in Lombard, Illinois. He noted that many of his classes were similar to those in medical school, with the biggest distinction being classes in chiropractic adjusting instead of pharmacy courses. He liked the idea that chiropractic care can boost health and prevent disease without drugs and chemicals.",
      "Dr. Conroy, DC, designs custom treatment plans to address a variety of conditions that cause pain or limit mobility, such as migraines, joint disease, and nerve compression. He often combines manual adjustments with cold laser therapy and physical therapy to help patients achieve optimum health.",
      "When he\u2019s not working with his patients, Dr. Conroy, DC, spends his time with his wife, Tori, and their three active sons. He also stays fit at the gym, riding area bike trails, sailing on Lake Michigan, and getting weekly preventive chiropractic adjustments. Dr. Conroy, DC, loves cooking, preferring recipes that call for fresh organic meats and vegetables.",
